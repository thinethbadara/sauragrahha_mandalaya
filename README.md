I was looking to do something else, more scientific, but I realized that I shouldn't have stopped studying math when I got to logarithms (how boring it was ...). 

Finally, something less precise has been left, although I think it is more visual and the concept is clearly seen.

A whole world this GSAP, there is so much to learn ...
